{"text": "An AI system used in manufacturing for predictive maintenance that employs machine learning to predict equipment failures, but lacks transparency in its decision-making process and has potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities in its data transmission protocols.", "violation": "borderline", "category": "accuracy_robustness", "severity": "borderline", "articles": ["Article 5", "Article 8"], "explanation": "The ambiguity arises from whether the AI system's opacity in decision-making (Article 5) and cybersecurity risks (Article 8) constitute high-risk under the EU AI Act. While predictive maintenance could be considered high-risk due to safety implications, the lack of explicit safety-related design goals and the system's integration with legacy industrial networks create uncertainty about its risk classification.", "context": "manufacturing", "ambiguity": true}

Personalized recommendations in e-commerce are not explicitly listed as high-risk, but could be argued to involve indirect discrimination (Article 8) or manipulative practices. The lack of disclosure creates ambiguity about whether the system meets transparency requirements for high-risk or limited-risk categories.", "context": "e-commerce", "ambiguity": true}
